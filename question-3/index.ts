// // // //Question 45: Cars: Create detailed car objects with flexible properties.

// // // Explain & TIP: Functions accepting a mix of fixed and arbitrary parameters let you create detailed and flexible objects. This is ideal for data with a few required fields and many optional fields.

// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
